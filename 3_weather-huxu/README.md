## Reflection Prompts

### New Learnings
What new tools, techniques, or other skills did you learn while doing this assignment?

How do you think you might use what you learned in the future?

I learned how providers and consumers work. I also learned how to use stateless and stateful widgets to make a live updating app.
Any mobile or web app will need to update and all apps have stateful and stateless parts.

## Challenges
What was hard about doing this assignment?
What did you learn from working through those challenges?
How could the assignment be improved for future years?

Changing icons based on weather conditions in WeatherConditionWidget. Not because it was hard, I just misread the specs and wasted an hour trying to make it work. I felt like this assignment was easier than the previous one. Maybe because I am more used to vscode, flutter and dart but I just felt more prepared for this assignment.
I still need to read specs more carefully and when I am stuck it might be because I misread the specs.
I felt like this assignment was great, maybe adding more weather conditions like snowy.

### Mistakes
What is one mistake that you made or misunderstanding that you had while you were completing this assignment?

What is something that you learned or will change in the future as a result of this mistake or misunderstanding?

I thought that I had to have the icons of WeatherConditionWidget in the constructor for some reason...
I need to read the specs more carefully...
