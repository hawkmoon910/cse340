# Peer Audit
**Auditor:** Leonardo Paredes (Group 9) <br> 		
**Auditee:** Group 11 <br>
**Time:** 3:45pm <br>
**Location:** CSE 2 <br>
**Devices:** Windows laptop & Android Iphone <br>
**Settings:** Default (font size, volume) as well as max font size <br>

## What the app does well
### Good Accessibility #1
**Description:** The contrast is good. <br> 
**Testing method:** Manually seeing <br>
**Explanation:** Without any data it is black and white which is of course a perfect contrast. With data it has blue and green but it all fits perfectly with the contrast screenshot.

### Good Accessibility #2
**Description:** Semantics is good <br>
**Testing method:** TalkBack <br>
**Explanation:** All the semantics are perfect. “Net change section” is one example which shows that for adding a transaction it shows the net change section. Another example is the transaction tile itself, “Button to edit transaction entry with name Leo. Amount 27.00…” which is perfect. <br>


## What the app does poorly
### Accessibility Issue #1
**Description:** Max text font pushes button off screen
Testing method: Changing font <br>
**Explanation:** This accessibility issue violates Success Criteron 1.4.10 - Reflow as the app on max font size is not fully functional. This could create a challenge for users with vision impairments who need to use their phone on a max font setting. As a result, some users may not be able to fully engage with the app. <br>
**Severity Rating:** 2 <br>
**Justification:** Frequency: This is infrequent in the app as the only error with the max font is that the button does not appear, other that that however the app does work perfectly. Impact: It is somewhat difficult to overcome this since adding a transaction for the app is no longer possible on max font. <br>
**Persistence:** The persistence is moderately high since it is difficult to work around this problem other than decreasing the font size. <br>
**Possible solution:** One possible solution is to make the text to the left of the button wrap instead of pushing away the button.
