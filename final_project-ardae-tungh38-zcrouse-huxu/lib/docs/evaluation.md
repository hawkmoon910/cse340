# SUS Testing Evaluation

You should evaluate the usability of your application, as well as its utility how well it addresses the need you have designed for.

## Method of SUS Testing

We gave our testers three tasks to complete and then had them fill out a google sheet form with the SUS testing questions. Then we took the data from the form to come up with a summary of the testing results.

### Task for SUS Testing:
1. Create 5 Transactions entries, at least 2 income transactions and 2 expense transitions.
2. Determine Account Balance
3. Enter financial statement view and determine estimated tax

## Summary of SUS Testing
After the SUS testing we found that our app was right near the average for SUS scores. From watching our users test the app we found some bugs in our code and some common points of confusion for the users. Below are the average scores from our SUS testing. 5/10 SUS scores were above average. Only 2 SUS scores were below 55.

### Average Scores
SUS Score: 68 <br>
Learnability Score: 76.25 <br>
Usability Score: 65.94
