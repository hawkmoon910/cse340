# Need
You must establish the need that your app addresses.
You can do this in several ways by gathering and synthesizing existing evidence (e.g. from prior research, news stories, etc.) to make a persuasive argument for the existence of a problem that your app will help with.

More than 40% of college students are in credit card debt and most of them say that credit card debt worries them the most.
