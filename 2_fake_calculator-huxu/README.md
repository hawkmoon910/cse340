A lot of flutter documentation

## Reflection Prompts

### New Learnings
What new tools, techniques, or other skills did you learn while doing this assignment?

How do you think you might use what you learned in the future?

The dart language, reading online documentation (never had to read this much), and semantics.
A new language might be useful as it may be used in a new job or it might be similar to that one. Reading documentation is something that everyone in the tech field will be to do when cooperating with others. Also writing good and readable documentation is nessacracy.

## Challenges
What was hard about doing this assignment?
What did you learn from working through those challenges?
How could the assignment be improved for future years?

Figuring out what I needed to do and what I needed exactly to accomplish it. Aka reading the spec slowly and correctly before getting a vague idea of what I need to do before looking for the documentation of what I need. Also getting the wide 0 button to work properly (still not working properly).
I learned that I need to read the spec more closely and I need to get better at understanding documentation because some of that had me confused for a bit.
More instructions for the semantics part.

### Mistakes 
What is one mistake that you made or misunderstanding that you had while you were completing this assignment? 

What is something that you learned or will change in the future as a result of this mistake or misunderstanding?

I thought that the button specification already sorted everything into the catergories of icon, int, and string. Or rather into three catergories for the correct colors.
I will read through code more throughly so I completely understand what it does, so I don't spend over 30 minutes confused on why this isn't sorting properly.
